# ConfFix

This repository contains the ConfFix tool, the evaluation detail and the benchmark of real-world configuration compatibility issues, which are available in three separate folders: tool and source code, evaluation, and DataSet.

# How ConfFix works
We give the video clip on how ConfFix repairs configuration compatibility issues provided in our motivating example.

# ConfFix benchmark

The benchmark now contains 86 reproducible CC issues.
For each issue, we provide:

* The issue report

* An executable APK that can reproduce the issue

* A bug-reproducing script and the reproduction steps

* The app source code with respect to each issue
